## Introduction to SPI-Birds pipelines

This repository contains the pipelines and quality checks for hole-nesting data included in the SPI-Birds Network and Database. For information on how to run pipelines please see the README. In short, pipelines can be run using `run_pipelines` and output data can be checked for potential irregularities using `quality_check`.
