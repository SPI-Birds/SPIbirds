\usage{
format_WYT(
  db = choose_directory(),
  species = NULL,
  pop = NULL,
  path = ".",
  output_type = "R"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{Location of database file.}

\item{species}{Species of interest. The 6 letter codes of all the species of
interest as listed in the
\href{https://github.com/SPI-Birds/documentation/blob/master/standard_protocol/SPI_Birds_Protocol_v1.0.0.pdf}{standard
protocol}. If blank will return all major species.}

\item{pop}{The three-letter code of population as listed in the \href{https://github.com/SPI-Birds/documentation/blob/master/standard_protocol/SPI_Birds_Protocol_v1.0.0.pdf}{standard
protocol}. For data owners with multiple populations (e.g. NIOO, UAN) where a single
pipeline is used for many populations this argument is used to extract data from
individual populations. For other pipelines that contain only one population
this argument can be ignored.}

\item{path}{Location where output csv files will be saved.}

\item{output_type}{Should the pipeline generate .csv files ('csv') or R objects ('R').}
}
\value{
4 data tables in the standard format (version 1.1.0). When `output_type = "R"`, a list of 4 data frames corresponding to the 4 standard data tables and 1 character vector indicating the protocol version on which the pipeline is based. When `output_type = "csv"`, 4 .csv files corresponding to the 4 standard data tables and 1 text file indicating the protocol version on which the pipeline is based.

\description{
A pipeline to produce a standard output for the nest box population in Wytham
Woods, UK, administered by Edward Grey Institute Oxford (Ben Sheldon).

\details{
This section provides details on data management choices that are unique to
this data. For a general description of the standard format please see
\href{https://github.com/SPI-Birds/documentation/blob/master/standard_protocol/SPI_Birds_Protocol_v1.1.0.pdf}{here}.

\strong{LocationID}: Unique locations are defined by using the nestbox IDs. These include
plot information as nest box numbers are not unique across plots.

\strong{ExperimentID}: There are experiment codes given, I have tried to
adapt these to the ExperimentID categories described in the standard
protocol; however, these need to be checked by data owners. For now I assume:
- Egg manipulation (code 2) is clutch size manipulation.
- Chick manipulation (code 3) is cross fostering.
- Alter temperature in nest box (code 7) only affects phenology.
- Feeding manipulation (code 8) affects phenology.
- Altering parasites, predation, competition and territory quality (codes 9, 11, 12, 13) all affect survival.

\strong{Species}: We include nests form blue tits, great tits, coal tits,
marsh tits, and nuthatches. Currently, mixed broods are treated as having no
species (NA), but we will fix this. There is one brood with Species 'w',
which I suspect is willow tit. This is currently ignored.

\strong{AvgEggMass}: There are two columns with mass data, one is a 'legacy'
column. When these overlap, they can differ up to 5g! I assume the 'legacy'
column is less preferred (due to it's name). I only use this data where no
other egg mass data is provided.

\strong{AvgChickMass}: Average egg mass is recorded for each brood; however,
this may include mass measurements taken outside of our focal period (14 - 16 days old).
Therefore, this column is ignored and AvgChickMass is calculated manually from
capture data.

\strong{HatchDate}: As with AvgEggMass, there is also a 'legacy' column for
hatch date. This is only used if the regular column is empty.

\strong{Age_observed}: Ages are assumed to follow EURING system and are
included unchanged. The only exception to this is '3J', which is an old EURING
code. This is treated as EURING age 3.

\strong{Tarsus}: Tarsus method is either 'M', 'S', or NA. We have assumed that
'M' and NA are the Oxford min/max method and converted accordingly. Currently, we treat
'S' as Svensson's Alternative and do not convert. This needs to be clarified with
data owner.

\strong{Sex_observed, Sex_calculated}: Any uncertainty in sex is ignored. For example, 'm?' is treated as male.

\strong{BroodIDLaid and BroodIDFledged}: There are (some) cases where BroodIDLaid/Fledged
have conflicting records for an individual. In these cases, BroodIDLaid/Fledged is
simply listed as 'CONFLICTED'.

\strong{CaptureAlive, ReleaseAlive}: All individuals are assumed to be captured and released alive.
