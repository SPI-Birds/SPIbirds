#' Calculate age based on when an individual was first captured - TEST LAB

#'
#' Arrange data by individual and year and then determine potential age in each
#' capture.
#'
#' We only consider whether an individual was captured as a chick or not. We
#' don't consider the adult age when an individual was first captured (e.g.
#' EURING 4 or 5) This prevents any cases where an individual might be wrongly
#' aged at first capture.
#'
#' When there is no observed age at first capture we assume it couldn't be a
#' chick or this would've been recorded.
#'
#' @param data Data frame. Data frame with capture information.
#' @param ID Unquoted expression (i.e. character without quotation marks). Name
#'   of column with individual identity.
#' @param Age Unquoted expression (i.e. character without quotation marks). Name
#'   of column with observed age of individual in each capture. Must be in
#'   EURING codes.
#' @param Date Unquoted expression (i.e. character without quotation marks).
#'   Name of column with CaptureDate information. Must be in format dd/mm/yyyy.
#' @param Year Unquoted expression (i.e. character without quotation marks).
#'   Name of column with year information. N.B. This could be different to
#'   CaptureDate if we are dealing with species that breed over two year (e.g.
#'   Southern Hemisphere species).
#' @param showpb Logical. Should a progress bar be shown?
#' @return A data frame with calculated age.
